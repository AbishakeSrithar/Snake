# Snake

If you would like to test my game out, download the 2 .rar files, extract them, open build, then exe.win-amd64-3.8, then click on snake.exe.

Made my 2nd game made with Tkinter using a tutorial by teclado: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB1aSBM8fvI  
Learning from my Space Shooter game, I made sure to comment out exactly what each line did and added a restart function using os and sys modules.  
From the video I learnt how to destruct tuples using asterisks, and got a taste for how tkinter works (images, tags, other tk.canvas methods).
